# cpp-basics
This repository contains my C++ practice programs while learning
fundamental concepts such as:
- Input and Output
- Data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Basic problem solving
Problems are inspired by practice platforms like HackerRank.
The solutions are written and cleaned for learning purposes.
